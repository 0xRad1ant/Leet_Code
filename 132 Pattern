# 132 Pattern

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers, nums, of length n. A 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers, nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k], where i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].

## Intuition

The brute force solution involves using multiple loops, but this approach is inefficient. A better solution is to use a stack to find the 132 pattern in a single pass through the array.

## Approach

1. Create a stack `decreasingStack` to keep track of decreasing elements.
2. Initialize `maxThirdElement` to the minimum possible value.
3. Traverse the array from right to left.
4. For each element in the array:
    - If the current element is less than `maxThirdElement`, return true (found a 132 pattern).
    - While the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is less than the current element:
        - Update `maxThirdElement` to the top element of the stack.
        - Pop the top element from the stack.
    - Push the current element onto the stack.
5. If no 132 pattern is found after traversing the array, return false.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(N)

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool find132pattern(vector<int>& nums) {
        int length = nums.size();

        // Check if the array has less than 3 elements
        if (length < 3)
            return false;

        // Stack to keep track of decreasing elements.
        stack<int> decreasingStack;

        // Maximum value of the third element in the 132 pattern.
        int maxThirdElement = INT_MIN;

        // Traverse the array from right to left
        for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int currentNumber = nums[i];

            // Check for 132 pattern
            if (currentNumber < maxThirdElement)
                return true;  // Found a 132 pattern.

            // Maintain the stack with decreasing elements
            while (!decreasingStack.empty() && decreasingStack.top() < currentNumber) {
                maxThirdElement = decreasingStack.top();
                decreasingStack.pop();
            }

            // Push the current element onto the stack.
            decreasingStack.push(currentNumber);
        }

        return false; // No 132 pattern found
    }
};
```

This algorithm finds the 132 pattern efficiently using a stack, making it suitable for large input arrays.
